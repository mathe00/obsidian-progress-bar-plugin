## 🛠️ Contributing

Let’s be honest, **I’m not a JavaScript expert** (nor TypeScript, for that matter 😅), but I’ve done my best to make this plugin functional. **I’m a Python developer**, so I understand what I’m doing to some extent, but JS and TS are different worlds for me. This plugin does what I need, so I don’t plan to take it much further. However, if you want to add features or improve the code, I’d be happy to see contributions!

Oh, and **English isn’t my first language**, so I apologize if I misunderstand something or take a bit longer to respond to issues or pull requests 😅. Thanks for your patience!

Feel free to open issues or pull requests, and I’ll do my best to respond, though **GitHub is still somewhat new to me**.
