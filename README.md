## 🛠️ Contributing

Let’s be honest, **I’m not a JavaScript expert** (nor TypeScript, for that matter 😅), but I’ve done my best to make this plugin functional. It does what I need, so I don’t plan to take it much further. However, if you want to add features or improve the code, I’d be happy to see contributions!

Feel free to open issues or pull requests, and I’ll do my best to respond, although **GitHub is not my strong suit yet**.

In the meantime, you can also check out my other plugins that I’ve developed solo with **GPT’s** help. They’re all on my GitHub profile!
